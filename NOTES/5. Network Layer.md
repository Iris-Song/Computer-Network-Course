# Network Layer
### Store-and-Forward Packet Switching

## datagram network 
+ Connectionless Service
+ no advance setup
+ `IP`(Internet Protocal)

## VC(virtual-circuit) network
+ connection-oriented
+ a path from source router all the way to the destination router must be established before any data packets can be sent.
+ When the connection is released, the virtual circuit is also terminated.
+ `label switching` replace connection identifiers in outgoing packets.

## Routing Algorithm
deciding which output line an incoming packet should be transmitted on.
+ datagram network: this decision must be made anew for every arriving data packet
+ VC network: routing decisions are made only when a new virtual circuit is being set up. (`session routing`)

### Nonadaptive algorithm (static routing)
choice of the route is computed in advance, off- line, and downloaded to the routers when the network is booted.
### adaptive algorithm (dynamic routing)
change their routing decisions to reflect changes in the topology, and sometimes changes in the traffic as well

### shortest path algorithm
Dijkstra

### Flooding
generates vast numbers of duplicate packets. have a hop counter contained in the header of each packet that is decremented at each hop, with the packet being discarded when the counter reaches zero.

A better technique for damming the flood is to have routers keep track of which packets have been flooded, to avoid sending them out a second time. One way to achieve this goal is to have the source router put a sequence number in each packet it receives from its hosts.
+ effective for broadcasting information
+ robust
+ fast(est)


### Distance Vector Routing (Bellman-Ford Routing)
+ Dynamic routing

each router maintains a routing table indexed by, and containing one entry for each router in the network. This entry has two parts: the preferred outgoing line to use for that destination and an estimate of the distance to that destination. The distance might be measured as the number of hops or using another metric, as we discussed for computing shortest paths.

`convergence` :The settling of routes to best paths across the network
+ slow
+ have `count-to-infinity` problem


### Link State Routing
+ Dynamic routing

1. **Discover its neighbors and learn their network addresses.** by sending a special HELLO packet. The router on the other end is expected to send back a reply giving its name.
2. **Set the distance or cost metric to each of its neighbors.** 
3. **Construct a packet telling all it has just learned.**
4. **Send this packet to and receive packets from all other routers.** include the age of each packet after the sequence number and decrement it once per second. When the age hits zero, the information from that router is discarded.
5. **Compute the shortest path to every other router.**

LSP : link state path
### Hierarchical Routing
routers are divided into `regions`

### Broadcast Routing
#### Impovement:

`reverse path forwarding`: When a broadcast packet arrives at a router, the router checks to see if the packet arrived on the link that is normally used for sending packets toward the source of the broadcast. If so, there is an excellent chance that the broadcast packet itself followed the best route from the router and is therefore the first copy to arrive at the router.

`spanning tree`

### Multicast Routing
pruning spanning tree

`core-based trees` :All of the routers agree on a root (called the core or rendezvous point) and build the tree by sending a packet from each member to the root. The tree is the union of the paths traced by these packets

protocal: MOSPF, DVMRP, PIM

IGNP


### Anycast Routing
a packet is delivered to the nearest member of a group

as part of `DNS`

can use regular distance vector and link state routing

support many different server at same address

## Internetworking
### How Networks Can Be Connected
1. build devices that translate or convert packets from each kind of network into packets for each other network
2. adding a layer of indirection and building a common layer on top of the different networks.

A router that can handle multiple network protocols is called a multiprotocol router. 

### Tunneling

## Network Layer in the Internet
### IP Address
IPv4: 32-bit

an IP address does not actually refer to a host. It really refers to a network interface. in practice, most hosts are on one network and thus have one IP address. routers have multi- ple interfaces and thus multiple IP addresses.

IP addresses are hierarchical, unlike Ethernet addresses. Each 32-bit address is comprised of a variable-length network portion in the top bits and a host portion in the bottom bits.

### CIDR (Classes InterDomain Routing)
+ `route aggregation`: combine multiple small prefixes into a single larger prefix. Rhe resulting large prefix is called `supernet`
+ packets are sent in the direction of the `longest matching prefix`
+ implemented by hardware

### classful addressing

### NAT (Network Address Translation)
![Placement and operation of a NAT box.](./img/Placement%20and%20operation%20of%20a%20NAT%20box..png)

### IP Version 6
+ 128-bit address.
+ IPv6 is not compatible with IPv4, but it is compatible with the other auxiliary Internet protocols, including TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, BGP, and DNS.
+ improvements compared with IPv4
  + has longer address
  + simplification of header, only 7 fields(versus 13 in IPv4)
  + better support for options
  + big advance in security 
+ Since many addresses will have many zeros inside them, three optimizations have been authorized.
  + leading zeros within a group can be omitted
    ```
    8000:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF
    ```
    can become
    ```
    8000::123:4567:89AB:CDEF
    ```
  + All the fields relating to fragmentation were removed because IPv6 takes a different approach to fragmentation.
  + the Checksum field is gone 

### Internet Control Protocols
+ ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocols)
  + ping
  + `traceroute`: Traceroute finds the routers along the path from the host to a destination IP address. It finds this information without any kind of privileged network support. The method is simply to send a sequence of packets to the destination, first with a TtL of 1, then a TtL of 2, 3, and so on.

+ ARP(Address Resolution Protocal)
  + IP addresses get mapped onto data link layer addresses, such as Ethernet by broadcast
  + `gratuitous ARP`:  have every machine broadcast its mapping when it is configured
  + `proxy ARP`: in special cases in which a host wants to appear on a network even though it actually resides on another network.
+ DHCP—The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  + When a computer is started, it has a built-in Ethernet or other link layer address embedded in the NIC, but no IP address. Much like ARP, the computer broadcasts a request for an IP address on its network.
  + Discover,offer,request,acknowledge,inform,disconnect 
  + use UDP datagrams
  + After about 50% of the lease time has elapsed, the client sends the server a DHCPREQUEST message to renew the lease. If server responds with DHCPACK, the lease and configuration parameters are updated
     If server responds with DHCPNAK
message, client must give up address
and start over at Step 1
```
Three ways for IP address allocation
1. Automatic allocation - permanently assigned - address can only be reclaimed by modifying configuration file/database
2. Dynamic allocation
3. Manual allocation - assigned by network administator
```
### MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching)
+ forwarding decisions can differ from those of IP address table
### OSPF—An Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
+ OSPF(Open Shortest Path First), become a standard protocal called `IS-IS`(Intermediate-System to Intermediate-System)
+ for internal routing, or `intradomain routing`.intradomain protocol has to do is move packets as efficiently as possible from the source to the destination. It does not have to worry about politics.
+ link state information is flooded to all routers within the same OSPF area.
+ type
  + Hello
  + Database Description
  + Link State Request
  + Link State Update
  + Link State Acknowledgement
+ LSDB synchronization process
  - Discover neighbor
  - Establish bidirectional communication
  - Elect a designated router, if desired
  - Form an adjacency
  - Discover the network routes
  - Update and synchronize link-state databases

### BGP—The Exterior Gateway Routing Protocal
+ BGP (Border Gateway Protocal)
+ exterior gateway protocal
+ have to worry about politics.
+ BGP routers advertise routes as they receive them, and they do not append their own identity to the paths.

### Internet Multicasting
+ IGMP(Internet Group Management Protocal)
+ PIM(Protocal Independent Multicast)
