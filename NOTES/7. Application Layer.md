# Application Layer
## DNS(The Domain Name System)
used for mapping host names to IP addresses

an application program calls a library procedure called the resolver, passing it the name as a parameter. The resolver sends a query containing the name to a local DNS server, which looks up the name and returns a response containing the IP address to the resolver, which then returns it to the caller. The query and response messages are sent as UDP packets. Armed with the IP address, the program can then establish a TCP connection with the host or send it UDP packets.

### The DNS Name Space
hierarchical addressing

the top of the naming hierarchy is managed by an organization called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

2 flavors: generic and countries

Domain names can be either absolute or relative.

Domain names are case-insensitive

2 query type: recursive query, iterative query. 
+ one name resolution can involve both mechanisms.
+ caching
+ UDP used for transport portocal
+ run on port 53
+ DNS is a distributed database maintained in a hierarchical tree structure

### Record Types in DNS
1. A – Address record name to 32 bit address
2. AAAA – Address Record name to 128 bit IPV6 address
3. CNAME – Canonical name after receiving this reply host will query with this new request
4. NS Records - Contain IP address of authoritative name server

NAME | TYPE | VALUE
---|---|--
bar.example.com. |CNAME |foo.example.com. 
foo.example.com. |A| 92.0.2.23

### Types of Name Servers
+ Two main types of servers
    + Authoritative - maintains the data
       + Master – where the data is edited
       + Slave – where data is replicated to
    + Caching – stores data obtained from an authoritative server
+ No special hardware necessary

### DNS caching
#### Purpose
+ improve efficiency
+ reducing latency

#### Where DNS Caching Occurs
+ Recursive DNS Servers
+ Client Devices: Some client devices, such as operating systems and web browsers, also perform DNS caching locally. This helps in speeding up the resolution of frequently visited websites without having to rely solely on the recursive DNS server for every query.
