# Application Layer
## DNS(The Domain Name System)
used for mapping host names to IP addresses

an application program calls a library procedure called the resolver, passing it the name as a parameter. The resolver sends a query containing the name to a local DNS server, which looks up the name and returns a response containing the IP address to the resolver, which then returns it to the caller. The query and response messages are sent as UDP packets. Armed with the IP address, the program can then establish a TCP connection with the host or send it UDP packets.

### The DNS Name Space
hierarchical addressing

the top of the naming hierarchy is managed by an organiza- tion called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

2 flavors: generic and countries

Domain names can be either absolute or relative.

Domain names are case-insensitive

2 query type: recursive query, iterative query. 
+ one name resolution can involve both mechanisms.
+ caching
+ UDP used for transport portocal
