# Data Link Layer
### Functions
1. provide a well-defined service interface to the network layer.
2. deal with transmission errors
3. regulate the flow of data so that slow receivers are not swamped by fast senders.

![Relationship between packets and frames.](./img/Relationship%20between%20packets%20and%20frames.png)

### Service
1. unacknowledged connectionless service (Ethernet)
2. acknowledged connectionless service (WiFi)
3. acknowledged connection-orientd service. Each frame is numbered, guarantee indeed received. Each frame is received **exactly once** and that all frames are received in **right order**.

### `Framing`
+ Data Layer Link breaks up the bit stream into discrete frames, compute a short token called a `checksum` for each frame, include checksum in the frame when it is transmitted. When a frame arrives at the destination, the checksum is recomputed. If the newly computed checksum is different from the one contained in the frame, the data link layer know that an error has occurred.
+ methods:
    1. Byte count (rarely use)
    2. Flag bytes with byte stuffing (insert ESC before flag byte, used in `PPP(Point-to-Point Protocal)`)
    3. Flag bits with bit stuffing (Each frame begins and ends with a special bit pattern(*0x7E*). When receiver sees 5 consecutive 1 bits, followed by a 0 bit, it will automatically destuffs the 0 bits. e.g.`USB`)
    ![Bit stuffing.](./img/Bit%20stuffing.png)
       + side effect of 2.3. :increase length
    4. Physical layer coding violations (some signals not occur in regular data)
    + Many data link protocal use a combination of these methods for safety. `preamble` used for Ethernet and 802.11.

## Error Detection and Correction
+ Error-detecting in Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer
+ Error-correcting in Physical Layer, Data Link Layer

### Error control 
1. receiver provide sender with some feedback(special control frames)
2. `timer`: In hardware troubles, receiver may not react at all. When sender transmit a frame, it starts a timer. Timer expire after an interval. When timer runs out, the sender will retransmit and assign sequence numbers.
### 2 ways deal with error
both add redundant information
1. `error-correcting codes` / `FEC(Forward Error Correction)`:enough redundancy - deduce what data must have been - used for channels make many errors(e.g. wireless links)
2. `error-detecting codes`:only redundancy - deduce an error has ocurred - used for reliable channels(e.g.fiber)
+ no one can handle all possible error, since the redundant bits that offer protection are as likely to be received in errors as the data bits.
### 2 error model
1. errors caused by extreme values of thermal noise. 
   + `erasure channel`: physical layer received an analog signal that was far from the expected value for a 0 or 1 and declared the bit to be lost. easier to correct.
2. errors tend to come in bursts rather than singly.

### Error-Correcting Codes
A frame consists of `m` data bits and `r` redundant(check) bits(total length is `n`(`n`=`m`+`r`)). called (`n`,`m`) code.
+ n-bit `codeword`: n-bit unit containing data and check bits
+ `code rate`: `m`/`n`

1. `block code`, `r` bits are computed solely as a function of `m` data bits, as though the `m` bits were looked up in a large table to find their corresponding `r` bits.
2. `systematic code`, `m` bits are sent directly, along with `r` bits.
3. `linear code`, `r` bits are computed as a linear function of the `m` data bits. XOR is a popular choice.

#### 1. Hamming codes
+ detect & correct error

`Hamming distance`: the number of bit positions in which two codewords differ. num1 `XOR` num2.

if two codewords Hamming distance is `d`, require `d` bits to convert one to another. To detect `d` errors, need `d+1` code. To correct `d` errors, need `2d+1` code.

allow all single errors to be detected

$$(m+r+1)\leq2^r$$

[example](https://www.zhihu.com/question/59719677)
#### 2. Binary convolutional codes
+ only one not block code we mentioned
+ encoder process a sequence of input bits and generates a sequence of output bits. no natural message size or encoding boundary as in a block code. The output depends on current and previous input bits. That is, encoder has memoey.
+ `constraint length`: the number of previous bits on which the output depends.
+ easy to factor the uncertainty of a bit being a 0 or a 1 into the decoding.
+ widely used in deployed networks (802.11)
#### 3. Reed-Solomon codes
+ linear block codes
+ Hamming codes operate on individual bits, Reed-Solomon codes operate on `m` bit symbols, involve mathematics
+ often combine with other codes
#### 4. Low-Density Parity Check codes
+ linear block codes

### Error-Detecting Codes
below all linear, systematic block codes
#### 1. Parity
+ distance of 2
+ encode: add 1 bit `0` or `1` at the end of codework to ensure it has even `1`(even parity)
+ `interleaving`: a better protection way, compute the parity bits over the data in a different order than the order in which the data bits are transmitted.
#### 2. Checksums
+ checksum means a group of check bits associated with a message, regardless of how are calculated.
+ stronger checksums based on a running sum of the data bits of the message.
+ checksum is usually placed at the end of the message.
#### 3. CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checks)/`polynomial code`
[example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/modulo-2-binary-division/)

### Flow Control
+ sender rate is significantly higher than receiver.
+ type:
    + `feedback-based flow control`: reciever send back info to sender
    + `rate-based flow control`: built-in mechanism limit rate without feedback

## Elementrary Data Link Protocals
### NIC (Network Interface Card)
### 1. A Utopian Simplex Protocal
+ transmiting and receiving network layers are always ready.
+ Processing time can be ignored.
+ Infinite buffer space.
+ error free
+ data transmit on one direction only
+ unrealistic, no flow control or error correction
### 2. A Simplex Stop-and-Wait Protocal for Error-Free Channel
+ error free
+ reciever powerful enough to process continuous stream
+ sender send one frame and then wait for an acknowlegement
### 2. A Simplex Stop-and-Wait Protocal for Noisy Channel
+ error exist
+ when a frame is damaged, the ewceiver hardware will detect when it computes the checksum.
+ If a valid acknowledgement comes in, the sender fetches the next packet from its network layer and puts it in the buffer, overwriting the previous packet. It also advances the sequence number. If a damaged frame arrives or the timer expires, neither the buffer nor the sequence number is changed so that a duplicate can be sent. In all cases, the contents of the buffer (either the next pack- et or a duplicate) are then sent.
+ When a valid frame arrives at the receiver, its sequence number is checked to see if it is a duplicate. If not, it is accepted, passed to the network layer, and an acknowledgement is generated. Duplicates and damaged frames are not passed to the network layer, but they do cause the last correctly received frame to be acknowledged to signal the sender to advance to the next frame or retransmit a damaged frame.

## SLIDING WINDOW PROTOCOLS
+ using `piggybacking`
+ each outbound frame contains a sequence number
+ if max window size is `n`, sender needs `n` buffer to hold the acknowledge frames.
+ window size of 1 means the data link layer only accepts frames in order, but for larger windows this is not so.

### One-Bit Sliding Window Protocal
![Two scenarios for protocol 1-bit](./img/Two%20scenarios%20for%20protocol%201-bit.png)

#### pipelining
#### 1. go-back-n
#### 2. selective-repeat
![Pipelining and error recovery](./img/Pipelining%20and%20error%20recovery.png)
### Protocal Using Go-Back-N
+ `w`: transmit up to `w` frames before blocking
+ `BD`: capacity one-way transit time.
$$link\quad utilization\leq \frac{w} {(1+2 BD)}$$
+ discard all subsequent frames, sending no acknowledgements for the discard frames. retransmit all unacknowledged frames in order, starting with damaged or lost one.
+ waste a lot of bandwidth
### Protocal Using Selective Repeat
+ `NAK`(negative acknowlegement)
+ maximum window size should be at most half the range of the sequence number. sequence number begin at 0.

$$ max \quad window \quad size = (MAX \underline{~} SEQ+1)/2$$
+ the number of buffer is equal to the window size, equal to the number of timers.

## Example
### Packet over SONET
+ Diff btw PPP & HDLC: PPP is byte oriented, HDLC(High-level Data Link Control) is bit oriented
### ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop)
