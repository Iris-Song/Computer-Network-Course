# Medium Access Control Sublayer
## Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
2 kinds:
1. classic Ethernet
+ original form
+ 3-10 Mbps
2. switched Ethernet
+ use switches to connect different computers
+ in practice
+ 100(fast Ethernet), 1000(gigabit Ethernet) and 10,000(10 gigabit Ethernet) Mbps

![Architecture of classic Ethernet.](./img/Architecture%20of%20classic%20Ethernet.png)
**repeater**: a physical layer device that receives, amplifies and retransmits signals in both directions.

![Collision detection can take as long as 2t](./img/Collision%20detection%20can%20take%20as%20long%20as%202t.png)
+ all frames must take more than $2\tau$ to send so that the transmission is still taking place when the noise burst gets back to the sender.
+ **binary exponential backoff**: After first, each station waits either 0 or 1 slot times at random before trying again. After i collisions, a random number between `0` and $2^i-1$
+ ensure a low delay when only a few stations collide but also ensures that the collisions are resolved are resolved in a reasonable interval when many stations collide.
+ CSMA/CD and Ethernet : no acknwledgement
+ appropriate for wired and optical fiber channels that have low rates.

### Hub & Switch
![(a) Hub. (b) Switch](./img/(a)%20Hub.%20(b)%20Switch.png)
+ Hub: 
   + telephone company. 
   + Hubs do not increase capacity because they are logically equivalent to the single long cable of classic Ethernet. 
   + All stations are in the same collision domain.
   + promiscuous mode: every computer that is attached can see the traffic sent between all of the other computers.
+ Switch: 
   + each port is its own independent collision domain. 
   + If cable is full duplex, both the station and the port can send a frame on the cable at the same time, not need CSMA/CD. If half duplex, must contend for transmission with CSMA/CD. 
   + have buffer
   + traffic is forwarded only to the ports where it is destined. more secure.
   + possible to use some of the ports as concentrators.

### Advantage
+ cheap
+ easy to maintain
+ interworks easily with TCP/IP

## Data Link Layer Switching
### bridges
+ join LANs together to make a larger LAN
+ Ethernet switch is a modern name of bridge
+ All of the stastions attached to the same port on a bridge belong to the same collision domain, and this is different than the collision domain for other ports.
+ decide by destination address.
   + big hash table. whenfirst plugged in, all hash tables are empty. use `flooding` algorithm. update in real time.
   + `backward learning`
   1. If the port for the destination address is the same as the source port, discard the frame.
   2. If the port for the destination address and the source port are dif- ferent, forward the frame on to the destination port.
   3. If the destination port is unknown, use flooding and send the frame on all ports except the source port
   + `spanning tree`
        + solve loop
+ only look at MAC address
+ inplement use hardware
+ a bridge with k ports will have k instances of MAC and physical layers

### gateways
+ connect two computers that use different connection-oriented transport protocals.

## VLAN (Virtual LAN)
problem of big LANs:
+ security
+ load
+ broadcast traffic
  + limit in scope -> VLAN

based on VLAN-aware switches

configuration tables set up in bridges.

Frame is sent according to label 'G'/'W'. only same label can be transmit.
