# Transport Layer
provide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destination machine with a desired level of reliablity that is independent of the physical networks.

## The Transport Service
+ Just as there are two types of network service, connection-oriented and connectionless, there are also two types of transport service.
+ connections have three phases: establishment, data transfer, and release.
+ **if the transport layer service is so similar to the network layer service, why are there two distinct layers?**
  + The transport code runs entirely on the users' machines, but the network layer mostly run on the routers, which are operated by the carriers.
  + The users have no real control over the network layer, so they cannot solve the problem of poor service by using better routers or putting more error handling in the data link layer because they don't own the routers. The only possibility is to put on top of the network layer another layer that improve the quality of service.
### Transport Service Primitives
+ the transport primitives can be implemented as calls to library procedures to make them independent of the network primitives.
+ The transport service is similar to the network service, but there are also differences.
   + The main diffrence is that the network service is intended to model the service offered by real networks, warts and all. Real networks can lose packets, so the network service is generally unreliable.
   + Whom the services are intended for. The network service is used only by the transport entities. Few users write their own transport entities. In contrast, many programs (and thus programmers) see the transport primitives.

  + In the asymmetric variant, either transport user can issue a DISCONNECT primitive, which results in a DISCONNECT segment being sent to the remote transport entity. Upon its arrival, the connection is released.
  + In the symmetric variant, each direction is closed separately. When one side does a DISCONNECT, that means it has no more data to send but it is still willing to accept data from its partner. In this model, a connection is released when both sides have done a DISCONNECT.

### Berkley Sockets

)
+ BIND is not required since the address used does not matter to the server
+ connection release with sockets is symmetric
+ The socket API is often used with the TCP protocol to provide a connection-oriented service called a **reliable byte stream**
+ Sockets can also be used with transport protocols that provide a message stream rather than a byte stream and that do or do not have congestion control. **DCCP** (Datagram Congestion Controlled Protocol) is a version of UDP with congestion control

## Transport Protocol
At the data link layer, two routers communicate directly via a physical channel, whether wired or wireless, whereas at the transport layer, this physical channel is replaced by the entire network.

### Addressing
**TSAP(Transport Service Access Point)** : a specific endpoint in the transport layer
+ permanently attached to a port, e.g. mail server on TCP port 25
+ **portmapper** : when a new service is created, it must register itself with the portmapper, giving both its service name (typically, an ASCII string) and its TSAP. The portmapper records this information in its internal database so that when queries come in later, it will know the answers.

### Connection Establishment
**three-way handshake**: TCP

![](./img/three-way%20handshake.png)

### Connection Release
+ asymmetric release: when one party hangs up, the connection is broken may result in data loss.
+ symmetric release: symmetric release treats the connection as two separate unidirectional connections and requires each one to be released separately.
+ First it receives a request from the client, which is all the data the client will send, and then it sends a response to the client. When the Web server is finished with its response, all of the data has been sent in either direction. The server can send the client a warning and abruptly shut the connection. If the client gets this warning, it will release its connection state then and there. If the client does not get the warning, it will eventually realize that the server is no longer talking to it and release the connection state. The data has been successfully transferred in either case.

### Error Control and Flow Control
solution are same as in data link layer
1. error-detecting code (e.g. CRC,checksum)
2. ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest)
3. stop-and-wait
4. sliding window

still have differences:
+ in function, The link layer checksum protects a frame while it crosses a single link. The transport layer checksum protects a segment while it crosses an entire network path, it is an end-to-end check.
+ in degree, consider retransmissions and the sliding window protocol. transport protocols generally use larger sliding windows.

### multiplexing
When a segment comes in, some way is needed to tell which process to give it to.
**inverse multiplexing** : SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol), can also find in link layer.

### crash recovery

## Congestion Control
### Desirable Bandwidth Allocation
A good allocation will deliver good performance because it uses all the available bandwidth but avoids congestion, it will be fair across competing transport entities, and it will quickly track changes in traffic demands. 
### Regulating sending rate
sending rate depends on the form of the feedback returned by the network.

The feedback may be explicit or implicit, and it may be precise or imprecise.
+ explicit, precise: when routers tell the sources the rate at which they may send. e.g.XCP (eXplicit Congestion Protocol)
+ explicit, imprecise: ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) with TCP. In this design, routers set bits on packets that experience congestion to warn the senders to slow down, but they do not tell them how much to slow down.

### Wireless issues

## UDP
+ connectionless
+ User Datagram Protocol
+ 8-byte header

![](./img/The%20UDP%20header.png)
+ UDP length: The minimum length is 8 bytes, to cover the header. The maximum length is 65,515 bytes, which is lower than the largest number that will fit in 16 bits because of the size limit on IP packets.
+ checksum(optical): It checksums the header, the data, and a conceptual IP pseudoheader. When performing this computation, the Checksum field is set to zero and the data field is padded out with an additional zero byte if its length is an odd number.
+ UDP does not do flow control, congestion control, or retransmission upon receipt of a bad segment. What it does do is provide an interface to the IP protocol with the added feature of demultiplexing multiple processes using the ports and optional end-to-end error detection.

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
### RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol)
### RTCP (Real-Time Transport Control Protocol).

## TCP
+ Transmission Control Protocol
+ reliable
### TCP Service Model
+ sockets
+ TCP connections are full duplex and point-to-point. Full duplex means that traffic can go in both directions at the same time. Point-to-point means that each connection has exactly two end points. TCP does not support multicasting or broadcasting.
+ A TCP connection is a byte stream, not a message stream. 
### TCP Protocal
+ every byte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number
+ A TCP segment consists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part) followed by zero or more data bytes.

![](./img/The%20TCP%20header.png)
+  CWR and ECE are used to signal congestion when ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) is used, ECE is set to signal an ECN-Echo to a TCP sender to tell it to slow down when the TCP receiver gets a congestion indication from the network. CWR is set to signal Congestion Window Reduced from the TCP sender to the TCP receiver so that it knows the sender has slowed down and can stop sending the ECN-Echo.
+ URG is set to 1 if the Urgent pointer is in use.
+ The ACK bit is set to 1 to indicate that the Acknowledgement number is valid.
+ The PSH bit indicates PUSHed data. The receiver is hereby kindly requested to deliver the data to the application upon arrival and not buffer it until a full buffer has been received (which it might otherwise do for efficiency).
+ The RST bit is used to abruptly reset a connection
+ The SYN bit is used to establish connections
+ The FIN bit is used to release a connection

### TCP Connection Establishment
three-way handshake
+ server excute LISTEN, ACCEPT
+ client excute CONNECT

### TCP Connection Release
**Nagle's algorithm**:  when data come into the sender in small pieces, just send the first piece and buffer all the rest until the first piece is acknowledged. Then send all the buffered data in one TCP segment and start buffering again until the next segment is acknowledged.

**silly window syndrome**

### TCP Timer Management
**RTO(Retransmission TimeOut)**:
SRTT (Smoothed Round-Trip Time)

### TCP Congestion Control
`slow start`

![](./img/Slow%20start%20from%20an%20initial%20congestion%20window%20of%20one%20segment.png)
To keep slow start under control, the sender keeps a threshold for the connection called the slow start threshold. Whenever a packet loss is detected, for example, by a timeout, the slow start threshold is set to be half of the congestion window and the entire process is restarted.

`fast retransmission`

## Performance Issue

### Performance problems
1. congestion
2. structural resource imbalance
3. broadcast storm
4. synchronous overload
5. setting timeouts
6. realtime application: Having enough bandwidth on average is not sufficient for good performance. Short transmission delays are also required.
### Measuring network performance.
### Host design for fast networks.
1. Host Speed Is More Important Than Network Speed
2. Reduce Packet Count to Reduce Overhead
3. Minimize Data Touching
4. Minimize Context Switches
5. Avoiding Congestion Is Better Than Recovering from It
6. Avoid Timeouts
### Fast segment processing.
### Header compression.
used to reduce the bandwidth taken over links by higher-layer protocol headers.
### Protocols for ‘‘long fat’’ networks.
long fat networks : gigabit networks that transmit data over large distances

## DELAY-TOLERANT NETWORKING (DTN)
In DTN terminology, a message is called a bundle.

DTN nodes are equipped with storage, typically persistent storage such as a disk or flash memory. They store bundles until links become available and then forward the bundles. The links work intermittently.
