#### differnce between `computer network` and `distributed system`
+ In a distributed system, e.g. Word wide Web,  a collection of independent computers appears to its user as a single content system. Often a layer of software on top of the operating sysytem called `middleware`.
+ computer network, users are exposed to the actual machines.
