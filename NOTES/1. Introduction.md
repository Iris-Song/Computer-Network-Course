# Introduction

#### differnce between `computer network` and `distributed system`
+ In a distributed system, e.g. Word wide Web,  a collection of independent computers appears to its user as a single content system. Often a layer of software on top of the operating sysytem called `middleware`.
+ computer network, users are exposed to the actual machines.
+ a distribute system is a software system built on top of a network. The distinction between a network and a distributed system lies with the **software** (especially the operating system), rather than with the hardware.

#### client-server model

#### peer-to-peer model
+ music sharing

#### RFID(Radio Frequency IDentification)
+ RFID tags are passive(no battery) chips, the size of stamps ,they can already be affixed to books, passports, credit cards.
+ RFID readers locate and communicate with the item over a distance of up to several meters.
+ cheap
+ Iot(Internet of things)

#### NFC(Near Field Communication)
+ equipped with NFC, the mobile can act as RFID smartcard and interact with a nearby reader for payment.

#### Sensor networks
+ made of nodes that gather and wirelessly relay information they sense about the state of the physical world. The nodes may be cars, phones or small seperate devices.

#### Wearable computers

|`WAN` (Wide)| 100km<br>1000km | country<br>continent ||transmission line; switch; router
|`Internet`| 10000km | planet |

#### broadcast network
+ both wireless and wired broadcast network can be divided into static and dynamic designs.
   + `static allocation`
      + devide time into discrete intervals and use round-robin algorithm, allowing each machine to broadcast only when its time slot comes up.
   + `Dynamic allocation`
      + `centralized`: single entry, accepting multiple packets and prioritizing them according to internal algorithm. 
      + `decentralized`: no central entity, each machine decide for itself whether to transmit

#### Diff btw WAN and large wired LAN
+ In WAN, the hosts and subnet are owned and operated by different people.
+ In WAN, routers will usually connect different kinds of networking technology.
+ In WAN, the thing connect to the subnet could be individual computers, or entire LANs. In LAN, it only can be computers.

#### `VPN`(Virtual Private Network)
+ a kind of `WAN`
+ `VPN` used to join the individual networks at different sites into one extended network
+ **pros**: virtualization, flexible reuse of a resource(Internet connectivity)
+ **cons**: lack of control over underlying resouces

#### `subnet`
+ a kind of `WAN`
+ may be run by different company
+ customers who connect to `ISP`(Internet Service Provider) receive Internet service.

#### Diff btw `subnets`,`networks`,`internetworks`
+ `subnet` refers to collection of routers and communication lines owned by network operator.
+ A `network` is formed by the combination of a subnet and its hosts.
+ `internetworks`, underlying technology is different in different parts.

#### connecting two different network
+ use `gateway`, both hardware and software.
+ Gateways are distinguished by the layer at which they operate in protocal hirarchy. The level of mid is just right.
+ router is a gateway

## Network Software
### protocal hierarchy
+ a `protocal` is an agreement between the communication parties on how communication is to proceed.
+ entities comprising the corresponding layers on different machines are called `peers`.
+ no data are directly transferred from layer *n* on one machine to another machine. Each layer passes data and control information to the layer immediately below it, until the lowest layer is reached.
+ `physical medium` is where communication actually occurs.
+ Btw each pair of adjacent is an `interface`. The interface defines which primitive operations and services the lower layer makes available to the upper one.
+ `network architecture`: a set of layers and protocals
+ `protocal stack`: a list of the protocals used by a certain system, one protocal per layer.

### disign issue for layer
+ **Reliability**
   + bits may be received damaged (inverted) due to fluke electronical noise, random wireless signals, hardware flaws, software bugs
   + **correctness** - `error detection`
      + Information that is incorrectly received can then be retransmitted until it is received correctly.
      + correct message is recovered from the possibly incorrect bits that were originally received.
      + Both work by adding redundant 
   + **find a working path** - `routing`
+ `protocal layering`
   + internetwroking
   + scalable
+ **Rsource Allocation**
   + `statistical multiplexing`: network sharing bandwidth based on the statistics of demand. It can be applied at any level of layer.
   + `flow control`
+  **Security**
   + mechanisms for **authentication**
   + **integrity**

### `Connection-Oriented` VS `Connectionless` Service
+ `Connection-Oriented`: establish a connection, use the connection, release the connection. 
   + message sequence
   + byte streams
+ `Connectionless`: each message carries the full destination address, routed independently. 
   + different names for messages in diff context:
      + `packet`: message at network layer.
   + Unreliable service is often called `datagram` service. 

![Six different types of service](./img/Six%20different%20types%20of%20service.png)
+ Why prefer unreliable communication to reliable in some cases?
   + reliable communication may not be available in given layer. (e.g.Ethernet. many reliable service are built on unreliable datagram service.)
   + delays inherent in providing reliable service may be unacceptable.

#### `store-and-forward switching` VS `cut-through switching`
+ `store-and-forward switching`: intermediate node receive a message in full before sending it on to the next node.
+ `cut-through switching`: onward transmission of a message at a node before it is completely received.

### Service Primitives
![Six service primitives that provide a simple connection-oriented service](./img/Six%20service%20primitives%20that%20provide%20a%20simple%20connection-oriented%20service.png)
![A simple client-server interaction using acknowledged datagrams.](./img/A%20simple%20client-server%20interaction%20using%20acknowledged%20datagrams.png)

### Service & Protocal & Interface
+ A `service` is a set of primitives(operations) that a layer provides to the layer above it.
+ A `protocal` is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of the messages that are exchanged by the peer entities within a layer. It is the layer's own business.
+ A layer's `interface` tells the processes above it how to use it.

## Reference Models
### OSI Reference Model
![The OSI reference model.](./img/The%20OSI%20reference%20model.png)
+ seven layer
+ not totally match the real world
+ `Physical Layer`
   + transmit raw bits
+ `Data Link Layer`
   + break up input data into `data frames`
   + transmit sequentially
   + if service reliable, receiver confirms correct receipt of each frame by sending back `acknowledgement frame`
   + traffic regulation mechanism
   + `medium access control`: a sublayer to control access to the shared channel on broadcast network.
+ `Network Layer`
   + control the operation of subnet
   + route
   + handle bottleneck and congestion
+ `Transport Layer`
   + determine what type of service to provide when connection is established.
   + a true end-to-end layer
+ `Session Layer`
   + `dialog control` : keep track of whose turn it is to transmit
   + `token management` : prevent two parties from attempting the same critical operation simultaneously
   + `synchronization` : checkpoint long transmission to allow them pick up from where they left off in the event of a crash and subsequent recovery
+ `Presentation Layer`
   + concerned with the syntax and sematics of the information transmitted
+ `Application Layer`
   + contain protocals, e.g. `HTTP`

### TCP/IP Reference Model
![The TCP/IP reference model.](./img/The%20TCP:IP%20reference%20model.png)
+ The protocal comes first, then the model
+ `Link Layer`
   + not really a layer at all
   + an interface btw hosts and transmission links
+ `Internet Layer`
   + linchpin that holds the whole architecture together
   + `IP` / `ICMP`
+ `Transport Layer`
   + `TCP`
      + reliable connection oriented protocal
      + flow control
      + sequencing
   + `UDP`
      + unreliable connectionless oriented protocal
+ `Application Layer`
   + `TELNET` / `FTP` / `SMTP` / `DNS` / `HTTP` / `RTP`

![The TCP/IP model with some protocols we will study.](./img/The%20TCP:IP%20model%20with%20some%20protocols%20we%20will%20study.png)

### Diff btw OSI & TCP/IP Reference MOdel
+ OSI: model comes first; TCP/IP: protocal comes first
+ OSI: supports both connectionless and connection- oriented communication in the network layer, but only connection-oriented communication in the transport layer; TCP/IP : supports only connectionless mode in the network layer but both in the transport layer
